## Here're a couple functions that provide the ability to cache 
## an inverse of a matrix. Caching can be beneficial during comlpex
## computations since it prevents overhead from re-doing things.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 
## There're also couple of helper functions in it

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    s <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        s <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() s
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse 
## from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {       
    s <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(s)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(s)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    s <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(s)
    s
}
